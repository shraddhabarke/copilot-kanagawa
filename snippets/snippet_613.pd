//| This class implements a set of FIFOs that use a single, statically partitioned block of memory.
// Note that when using the blocking version, a call for one of the FIFO instances that blocks will also
// block subsequent calls for other FIFO instances, even if those calls would otherwise not block.
// In other words, there is head of line blocking across FIFOs.
