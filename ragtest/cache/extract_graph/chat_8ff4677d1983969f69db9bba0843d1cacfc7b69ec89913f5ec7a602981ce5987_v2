Understanding this material is not required for using Sandpiper, but can be helpful to those with a hardware background.\n\n\nControl Flow\n\n\nOverview\n\nLike most compilers for imperative languages, the Sandpiper compiler decomposes source code into basic blocks and branches. A basic block is a sequence of statements with the property that if a particular thread executes the first statement in a block, that thread will execute all statements in the block. A branch is a link between basic blocks. Each basic block corresponds to a pipeline in the generated hardware. Each branch corresponds to a FIFO in the generated hardware.\n\nThe function below corresponds to a single basic block. FIFOs hold the function arguments and the return value.\n\nuint32 F(uint32 x)\n{\n    uint32 y = x + 2;\n\n    uint32 z = y * 10;\n\n    return z / 4;\n}\n\n\nThreads\n\nThreads in Sandpiper are runtime constructs. The source does not specify the number of threads that will be created. A thread is defined by:\n\n- Context: A value for each local variable\n- Location: The next statement that the thread will execute\n\nIn the generated hardware, thread context is stored in pipeline registers or FIFOs. Thread locations change as the thread moves through generated pipelines. At any particular moment in time, a specific thread exists in either a specific pipeline stage or in a particular slot in a FIFO.\n\nThreads physically progress through the generated hardware in a way that is analogous to how threads logically progress through the statements in the source code. The following diagram illustrates how a set of threads progress through a function over time.\n\n\nstatic for\n\nstatic for replicates the body of the static for loop. If there are no data dependencies between loop iterations static for translates to a wide pipeline.\n\nuint32[4] x;\nuint32[4] y;\n\nstatic for (const auto i : 4)\n{\n    y[i] = (x[i] + 2) * 3;\n}\n\nThe depth of the generated pipeline can increase if there are data dependencies between loop iterations.\n\nuint32[4] x;\nuint32[4] y;\n\n// This variable is read and written by each loop iteration\nuint32 z = 3;\n\nstatic for (const auto i : 4)\n{\n    y[i] = (x[i] + 2) * z;\n\n    z = z + x[i];\n}\n\n\nConditions\n\nif/else and switch statements are implemented with multiplexers.\n\nuint32 x;\nuint32 y;\nuint32 z;\n\nif (x > 3)\n{\n    y = z;\n}\nelse\n{\n    y = 9;\n}\n\nMultiplexers are only inserted when needed to ensure correctness. For example, the following code:\n\nuint32 x;\nuint32 y;\nuint32 result = 19;\n\nif (x == 4)\n{\n    uint32 z = y + 4;\n    uint32 w = x * 6;\n\n    result = z - w;\n}\n\nproduces the same hardware as:\n\nuint32 x;\nuint32 y;\nuint32 result = 19;\nbool b = (x == 4);\n\n{\n    // Note how the variable 'b' is not used to compute z nor w\n    uint32 z = y + 4;\n    uint32 w = x * 6;\n\n    result = b ? z - w : result;\n}\n\n\nCall Site\n\nFunction call sites require a FIFO that saves a per-thread context at the call site. In the example below, the local variables that are saved in the context are a and b . This FIFO is only required for function calls that are not inlined by the compiler.\n\nuint32 G(uint32 x)\n{\n    return x + 1;\n}\n\nuint32 F(uint32 a)\n{\n    uint32 b = a + 2;\n\n    uint32 c = G(a + 4);\n\n    return b + c;\n}\n\n\nMultiple Call Sites\n\nCalls to a non-inlined function from multiple call sites are implemented by adding a FIFO at each call site. An arbiter selects between these FIFOs and routes values into the entry FIFO for the called function. This arbiter uses a round-robin arbitration scheme for each call, except in the case where the called function has a boolean parameter with the end_transaction attribute.\n\nuint32 F(uint32 a)\n{\n    return G(a + 1);\n}\n\nuint32 H(uint32 b)\n{\n    return G(b + 2);\n}\n\nuint32 G(uint32 x)\n{\n    return 2*x;\n}\n\n\nasync_exec\n\nA call to async_exec is implemented with a single FIFO. For the common case of passing a lambda to async_exec , the FIFO holds the value of each variable captured by the lambda.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
