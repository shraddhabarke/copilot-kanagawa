The is_valid field is set to true if no ECC errors (corrected or not) were detected.\n\n\nmemory_ecc_relaxed\n\nReads from a memory_ecc_relaxed return a value of type: optional<T> .

The function creates values returned by reads from the memory. The function takes 3 arguments:\n\n- error - A bool set to true when an ECC error was detected, regardless of whether it was corrected or not.\n- valid - A bool set to true if there was no ECC error, or an error was corrected.\n- value - Data read from memory. The type of the argument is the same as the type of declared memory word.\n\nerror - A bool set to true when an ECC error was detected, regardless of whether it was corrected or not.\n\nvalid - A bool set to true if there was no ECC error, or an error was corrected.\n\nvalue - Data read from memory. The type of the argument is the same as the type of declared memory word.\n\n\nMulti-Dimensional Arrays\n\nuint32[4][2] can be thought of as a table containing 4 rows and 2 columns:\n\nFor example, the following table:\n\ncan be expressed with the following code:\n\nuint32[4][2] table = { {3, 4}, {9, 2}, {7, 8}, {1, 5} };\n\nThe expression: table[1] represents row 1. It has has type uint32[2] , and value {9, 2} .\n\nThe expression table[1][0] represents the entry at row 1, column 0. It has type uint32 and value 9 .\n\nArrays of memories are supported:\n\nmemory<uint32, 32>[4] _mem; // An array of 4 memories\n\nSimilarly, memories of arrays are supported:\n\nmemory<uint32[4], 32> _mem; // A memory with element type = uint32[4]\n\nMemories of memories are not allowed.\n\n\nIndex/Count type aliases\n\n\nindex_t\n\nindex_t<N> is an unsigned integer type wide enough to represent the values: 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1 . This type is intended to be used to define an address or index for elements of an array or a memory.\n\nconst auto array_size = 8;\n\nuint32[array_size] a;\n\n// wide enough to represent an index into a\nindex_t<array_size> idx;\n\nprintln(a[idx]);\n\n\ncount_t\n\ncount_t<N> is an unsigned integer type wide enough to represent the values: 0, 1, 2, ..., N . This type is useful for holding sizes or counts.\n\nconst auto max_elements = 8;\n\n// wide enough to represent the maximum number of elements\ncount_t<max_elements> current_element_count = 0;\n\n\nFunction types\n\nThe syntax for a function type is (parameter types)->return type :\n\nusing callback = (uint32, bool) -> uint8;\n\nFunction types can optionally include parameter names:\n\nusing callback = (uint32 x, bool f) -> uint8;\n\n\nType aliases\n\nType aliasing allows giving new names to existing data types. Type aliases can be created for both built-in and user-defined types.\n\nusing UnsignedInteger = uint32;\nusing DWORD = UnsignedInteger;\nusing callback_t = (int32, uint5) -> bool;\n\n\nSubtyping\n\nSandpiper defines subtyping relationship for integer types and function types. A value of type S can be safely used in context expecting a type T if and only if the type S is a subtype of the type T .\n\nUsing the notation S <: T to mean that type S is a subtype of type T , the following relations are defined for integer types:\n\n- int<N> <: int<M> when N <= M\n- uint<N> <: uint<M> when N <= M\n- uint<N> <: int<M> when N < M\n\nFor function types subtyping relationship:\n\n[[attr1]] ([[paramAttr1]] x1, ...) -> r1 <: [[attr2]] ([[paramAttr2]] x2, ...) -> r2\n\nrequires all of the following to be true:\n\n- r1 <: r2\n- x2 <: x1 , …\n- paramAttr2 is subset of paramAttr2 , …\n- attr2 is a subset of attr1\n\nFor example function type (uint32) -> uint8 is a subtype of (uint16) -> uint16 . Intuitively this is because callers expecting a function (uint16) -> uint16 can call a function of type (uint32) -> uint8 without any data loss: - argument of type uint16 can be losslessly upcast to uint32 - result of type uint8 can be upcast to uint16\n\nSubtyping of function types applies in any context where functions are used as values, such as functions passed as arguments to higher order functions, arguments passed for function type template parameters, and class callbacks\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
