Sandcastle allows the programmer to write documentation for any entity adjacent to the definition of the entity in the source code.\n- Documentation annotations are non-intrusive and do not obfuscate the source code. Annotations should be lightweight and easy to read and write while also supporting basic markdown features.\n- Recognize the language scopes and module system. Generated documentation should display information important to users.\n- Navigation via hyperlinks. Documentation generated by Sandcastle makes abundant use of hyperlinks and anchors. Identifiers are linked and declarations are anchored including their respective components. Furthermore, user-written annotations may contain hyperlinks.\n- Produce documentation in multiple formats. Sandcastle supports a markdown and html backend. Adding new backends is straightforward and flexible.\n\n\nInvocation Â¶\n\nSandcastle is invoked from the command line:\n\nsandcastle [OPTIONS] [FILE]\n\nWhere each FILE is a filename containing a Sandpiper source module. Files can be absolute paths or relative paths to the current directory. Use the option -? or --help to see a list of all command line options.\n\nThe modules specified on the command line are processed together. When one module refers to an type declared in another module being processed, the documentation will link to that declaration. The modules should not be mutually recursive. Currently, links to entities that cannot be found will be dead links.\n\nSandcastle currently only supports generating Markdown and HTML documentation.\n\n\nDocumentation and markup Â¶\n\nSandcastle recognizes special documentation annotations in the Sandpiper source file and transforms these into generated documentation. If there are no annotations, Sandcastle generates documentation that incorporates exposed type alias, enum, struct, function, and class declarations.\n\nThe annotation is a language comment and is parsed by the PipeDream compiler using the --parse-docs command-line switch.\n\n\nDocumenting top-level declaration Â¶\n\nThe simplest documentation annotation is for a top-level declaration. Suppose the source file contains the following function:\n\ntemplate <typename T>\ninline T xor(T a, T b)\n{\n    return a ^ b;\n}\n\nThen we can document it like this:\n\n//| Return xor of inputs.\ntemplate <typename T>\ninline T xor(T a, T b)\n{\n    return a ^ b;\n}\n\nThe annotation begins with the //| syntax and applies to the following declaration in the source file. Additionally, Sandcastle supports writing documentation after the declaration by using //< .\n\ntemplate\n  < typename T //< Type of number to square\n  , typename R //< Return type of squared number\n  >\ninline R square\n    ( T x //< Input number\n    )\n{\n    return x * x;\n}\n//< Square a number\n\nAnnotations can span several lines and continue until the first non-comment line in the source file.\n\n//| Adds two values of the input type.\n// Returns the result as the output type, which might be larger.\n// e.g. 3 fits in a uint2, but 3 + 3 does not.\ntemplate <typename R, typename T>\ninline R add(T a, T b)\n{\n    return a + b;\n}\n\nThe line comment style // requires a single space of margin after the comment prefix, | or / , and after each subsequent line.\n\nAnnotations can also utilize Sandpiperâs multi-line comment style. This style does not require a single space margin.\n\n/*|\nAdds two values of the input type.\nReturns the result as the output type, which might be larger.\ne.g. 3 fits in a uint2, but 3 + 3 does not.\n*/\ntemplate <typename R, typename T>\ninline R add(T a, T b)\n{\n    return a + b;\n}\n\n\nDocumenting parts of a declaration Â¶\n\nIn addition to annotating a top-level declaration, Sandcastle supports documenting parts of a declaration.\n\n\nClass methods, variables, and callbacks Â¶\n\nClass methods and variables are annotated using //| in the same way as top-level declarations. Public members are always displayed. Private callbacks will always be displayed. All other private members will be displayed only if they are annotated with a Sandcastle comment.\n\ntemplate <auto Maximum, auto Initial>\nclass counter\n{\npublic:\n    //| Convenient type alias.\n    using ctr_t = count_t<Maximum>;\n\nprivate:\n    //| This is displayed in generated documentation.\n    ctr_t _first = Initial;\n\n    ctr_t _second = 0; // This will not be displayed.\n\n    (uint32 x) -> uint2 callback; // This will be displayed\n                                  // even if it is not annotated.\n\npublic:\n    //| Returns the current count.\n    inline ctr_t count()\n    {\n        ctr_t result;\n        atomic\n        {\n            result = _first - _second;\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n}\n\n\nstruct, enum\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
