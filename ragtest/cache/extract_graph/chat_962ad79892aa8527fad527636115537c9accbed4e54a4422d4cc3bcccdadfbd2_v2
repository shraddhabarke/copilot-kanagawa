shared state. The list is sorted by complexity (or verification effort required). Strive to write most Sandpiper code using low complexity idioms.\n\n\nNo shared state\n\nSandpiper code that only accesses local variables is the lowest risk. An added benefit of this pattern is that it allows high clock frequencies to be achieved because constructs like atomic , [[schedule(n)]] , atomic do are not needed.\n\nuint32 F(uint32 a, uint32 b)\n{\n    return a + b;\n}\n\n\nShared variables exclusive to one atomic block\n\nThe fool-proof way to use a shared variable is to access that shared variable from only 1 atomic / [[schedule(N)]] block. One way to ensure this is to declare a static local variable within an atomic block. Using this pattern ensures a compile-time error if the shared variable is accessed outside of the block where it is declared.\n\nA typical use case for this pattern is when multiple threads all execute a common code path.\n\nuint32 Accumulate(uint32 a, bool reset)\n{\n    uint32 result;\n\n    atomic\n    {\n        // Shared variable, only visible within the atomic block\n        static uint32 _sum = 0;\n\n        _sum = reset ? a : _sum + a;\n        result = _sum;\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}\n\nThis common idiom is abstracted by the function attomically defined in the standard library module sync.atomic .\n\nimport sync.atomic\n\nuint32 Accumulate(uint32 a, bool reset)\n{\n    const auto x = atomically([a, reset](uint32 x) -> uint32\n    {\n        return reset ? a : x + a;\n    });\n\n    return x.second;\n}\n\nVerification considerations:\n\n- Is the initial value of the shared variable correct? Remove the initial value and verify that tests fail.\n- Have all control signals (like reset above) been tested?\n- For [[schedule(N)]] blocks, is the value of N correct? Increase the value of N and verify that tests fail.\n\n\nShared variable with 1 write location\n\nIf a shared variable must be accessed outside of a single atomic / [[schedule(N)]] block, try to design the code such that there is only one statement that writes to the shared variable.\n\nclass Accumulator\n{\nprivate:\n    uint32 _sum = 0;\n\npublic:\n    void Accumulate(uint32 x, bool reset)\n    {\n        atomic\n        {\n            // The only place where _sum is written\n            _sum = reset ? x : _sum + x;\n        }\n    }\n\n    uint32 GetResult()\n    {\n        return _sum;\n    }\n}\n\nVerification considerations:\n\n- Do writes to the shared variable need to be placed in atomic blocks? If multiple shared variables are written at nearby lines, most likely the writes should be contained within an atomic block.\n- Do reads of the shared variable need to be placed in atomic blocks? If multiple shared variables are read in nearby lines, most likely the reads should be contained within an atomic block.\n- What synchronization is needed between the write and read\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
