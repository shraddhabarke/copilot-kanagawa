If multiple shared variables are written at nearby lines, most likely the writes should be contained within an atomic block.\n- Do reads of the shared variable need to be placed in atomic blocks? If multiple shared variables are read in nearby lines, most likely the reads should be contained within an atomic block.\n- What synchronization is needed between the write and read locations?\n- For non-replicated memories: can a data race occur (multiple concurrent reads)?\n- Is the initial value of the shared variable correct? Remove the initial value and verify that tests fail.\n- Have all control signals (like reset above) been tested?\n- For [[schedule(N)]] blocks, is the value of N correct? Increase the value of N and verify that tests fail.\n\n\nShared variable with multiple write locations\n\nThe most complex code contains multiple statements that each can write to a shared variable. Read the following code an convince yourself that a data race is impossible (two threads writing to _flag concurrently).\n\nvoid F()\n{\n    // Shared variable, with multiple write locations\n    static bool _flag = false;\n\n    bool local_flag;\n\n    atomic\n    {\n        local_flag = _flag;\n\n        if (!_flag)\n        {\n            // write location 1\n            _flag = true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // more code here\n\n    atomic\n    {\n        if (!local_flag)\n        {\n            // write location 2\n            _flag = false;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nVerification considerations:\n\n- Can a data race occur (concurrent writes to the same shared variable)?\n- Do writes to the shared variable need to be placed in atomic blocks?\n- Do reads of the shared variable need to be placed in atomic blocks?\n- What synchronization is needed between the write and read locations?\n- For non-replicated memories: can a data race occur (multiple concurrent reads)?\n- Is the initial value of the shared variable correct? Remove the initial value and verify that tests fail.\n- Have all control signals been tested?\n- For [[schedule(N)]] blocks, is the value of N correct? Increase the value of N and verify that tests fail.\n\n\nThreading\n\n\nComputing number of threads for a vectorized loop\n\nIf item_count items must be processed by a loop (such as a call to pipelined_for ) which operates on M elements per iteration, use code like the following to compute the number of loop iterations and the number of items processed by the final iteration.\n\nimport numeric.int.operator\n\nconst auto M = 4;\n\nvoid f(uint32 item_count)\n{\n    auto iter = ceil_div_mod<1>(item_count, M);\n\n    // iter.first contains the number of loop iterations\n    // iter.second contains the number of items processed by the last loop iteration\n}\n\n\nCompiler Settings\n\nThe following command line parameters trade compile time for quality of generated hardware.\n\n\nMax register ratio\n\nThe --max-register-ratio setting allows the compiler to use a higher register ratio within [[schedule(N)]] blocks to meet the schedule constraint while better dividing logic across pipeline stages. Increasing the difference between --register-ratio and --max-register-ratio adds extra iterations to the compiler scheduling, increasing compiler execution time.\n\n\nOptimizing Output For Specific Downstream Tools\n\nThe --sparse-reg-opt command line switch causes the compiler to remove bits from pipeline registers that are known to be unused or constant. Some synthesis tools can perform a similar optimization.\n\n\nMulticore compilation\n\nThe jobs=N command line option controls the number of parallel jobs the compiler spawns. Generally the value should not be set higher than number of logical processors, which is the default, but in some cases compilation might run faster with fewer jobs, especially if the machine has a lot of cores and/or there is not enough compilation parallelism in the project to exploit.\n\nThe compiler can better exploit compilation parallelism if the design logic is spread across multiple files (modules). This is a good practice for organizing projects not just to optimize compilation speed but also for general code maintainability.\n\n\nArea\n\n\nMinimize Basic Block Count\n\nA basic block is a sequence of statements with the property that if a given thread executes the first statement of a basic block, that thread will execute all statements in the basic block. In general, try to minimize the total number of basic blocks in a design. This avoids fixed overhead associated with each basic block, and makes compiler optimizations more effective. Static analysis can be used to inspect the set of basic blocks used to implement a particular design.\n\nThe following control flow constructs do not introduce new basic blocks:\n\n- static for\n- if / else\n- switch\n- Inline function calls\n\n\natomic do\n\natomic do usually introduces a new basic block (which contains the atomic do loop body, loop condition, and the statements following atomic do .) This additional basic block can be avoided by hoisting the atomic do statement to the top of the containing function.\n\nOriginal:\n\nvoid F(uint32 x)\n{\n    static uint32 _counter;\n\n    // This line forces the atomic do\n    // to introduce a new basic block\n    uint32 y = x + 2;\n\n    atomic do {} while (x > _counter);\n}\n\nOptimized:\n\nvoid F(uint32 x)\n{\n    static uint32 _counter;\n\n    atomic do {} while (x > _counter);\n\n    uint32 y = x + 2;\n}\n\nA common pattern to enable hoisting atomic do statements is to split atomic do blocking into a separate method:\n\nOriginal:\n\nimport data.counter\n\nclass IntegerAllocator\n{\nprivate:\n    counter<32, 32> _free_count;\n    uint32 _id = 0;\n\n    inline bool wait_internal()\n    {\n        bool result = false;\n\n        if (_free_count.count() > 0)\n        {\n            result = true;\n            _free\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
