A typical example is to identify the first and/or last thread within a group:\n\nconst auto numIter = 256;\n\npipelined_for(numIter, [numIter](uint32 thread_id)\n{\n    bool is_first = (thread_id == 0);\n    bool is_last = (thread_id == (numIter - 1));\n\n    // a bunch of code\n\n    // is_first and is_last are still valid\n\n    if (is_last)\n    {\n        println(\"last thread done\");\n    }\n});\n\nThe only language construct that enables two threads to change order is a loop with the [[unordered]] attribute. If two threads take different number of trips through the loop, then they can leave the loop in a different order than they entered. If the [[unordered]] attribute is not present, then threads that finish all loop iterations will be held in a buffer and not allowed to move past the loop until all preceding threads have.\n\nIf threads can exit a function in a different order than they entered, then the function must have the [[unordered]] attribute. This requirement is enforced at compile time.\n\nUnordered loops and functions are useful in cases where a set of threads each execute a loop and there are significant differences in the trip counts among the threads. If the application demands a low latency for threads with low trip counts, then an unordered loop can ensure that these threads are not held up by the threads with high trip counts.\n\nThe reorder block can be used to put threads back into their original order.\n\nconst auto numIter = 256;\n\npipelined_for(numIter, [](uint32 thread_id)\n{\n    uint2 trip_count = thread_id + 4;\n\n    reorder\n    {\n        [[unordered]]\n        for (const auto i : trip_count)\n        {\n        }\n\n        // This will _not_ print thread IDs in order\n        println(\"at end of loop\", thread_id);\n    }\n\n    // This _will_ print thread IDs in order\n    println(\"after reorder\", thread_id);\n});\n\n\nScheduling constraints\n\nThe [[schedule(N)]] attribute can be used to constrain operator scheduling. [[schedule(N)]] forces the compiler to ensure that no more than N threads can be present in a block of code at any moment in time. This is accomplished by ensuring that the generated hardware corresponding to the block of code is scheduled into N pipeline stages.\n\n[[schedule(N)]] is frequently used as a synchronization construct. In the example below, [[schedule(1)]] is used to ensure that a shared variable is updated atomically.\n\n// This variable is shared among threads\nstatic uint32 res = 0;\n\n// Only 1 thread allowed in this block at a time\n[[schedule(1)]]\n{\n    // Read-modify-write the shared variable\n    uint32 sum = res + 2;\n    res = sum * 6;\n}\n\nWithout the [[schedule(1)]] , there could be a bug where the addition and multiplication occur on different clock cycles. The following tables illustrates how such a bug could occur.\n\nWith [[schedule(1)]] :\n\nWithout [[schedule(1)]] :\n\nThe atomic keyword is a synonym for [[schedule(1)]] :\n\n// This variable is shared among threads\nstatic uint32 _counter = 0;\n\n// Only 1 thread allowed in this block at a time\natomic\n{\n    // Read-modify-write the shared variable\n    _counter = _counter + 2;\n}\n\nIt is common practice in Sandpiper to read-modify-write the contents of memories in a [[\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ADDONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A function that adds one to its input)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADDONEINLINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An inline function that adds one to its input, allowing for four additions per clock cycle)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MULTIPLY_BY_THREE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A class that multiplies its input by three, with different execution strategies affecting throughput and execution time)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANDPIPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A programming model or language that includes constructs for parallel computing and synchronization)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADDONE<|>ADDONEINLINE<|>Both functions perform addition operations but with different implementation details and performance characteristics<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MULTIPLY_BY_THREE<|>ADDONE<|>Multiply_by_three and AddOne represent different mathematical operations within the same computational model<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MULTIPLY_BY_THREE<|>ADDONEINLINE<|>Multiply_by_three and AddOneInline are related through their role in demonstrating computational operations in Sandpiper<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANDPIPER<|>ADDONE<|>AddOne is a function that can be used within the Sandpiper programming model<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANDPIPER<|>MULTIPLY_BY_THREE<|>Multiply_by_three is a class that demonstrates object-oriented features in Sandpiper<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
